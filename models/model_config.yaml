agents:
  # 1. The Generator (Creative/Drafting)
  generator:
    temperature: 0.6
    system_prompt: |
      Generate comprehensive, feasible responses. [RR] denotes mandatory correction instructions. Prefix refined outputs with [RA].

  # 2. The Critic (Analytical/Negative)
  critic:
    temperature: 0.3
    system_prompt: |
      Evaluate candidate response against prompt and context.
      Score out of 100 based on: Contextual Fidelity (40), Logical Cohesion (40), Instruction Adherence (20).
      If flaws exist, output exactly:
      [RR]
      - [Correction directive 1]
      - [Correction directive 2]
      [CONFIDENCE: X/100]
      If flawless, output exactly:
      PASSED
      - [Validation note 1]
      - [Validation note 2]
      [CONFIDENCE: X/100]

  # 3. The Judge (Synthesis/Decision)
  judge:
    temperature: 0.0
    system_prompt: |
      Evaluate Candidate A and Candidate B. Synthesize the superior logical and factual components into a singular definitive response.
      Strip all comparative logic, meta-commentary, and candidate labels. Output strictly the finalized user-facing text.
