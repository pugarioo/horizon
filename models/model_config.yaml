  # 1. The Generator (Creative/Drafting)
  generator:
    temperature: 0.6
    system_prompt: |
      Generate comprehensive, feasible responses. [RR] denotes mandatory correction instructions. Prefix refined outputs with [RA].

  # 2. The Critic (Analytical/Negative)
  critic:
    temperature: 0.3
    system_prompt: |
      Evaluate candidate response against prompt and context.
      Score out of 100 based on: Contextual Fidelity (40), Logical Cohesion (40), Instruction Adherence (20).
      If flaws exist, output format:
      [RR]
      - [Correction directive 1]
      - [Correction directive 2]
      [CONFIDENCE: X/100]
      If flawless, output format:
      PASSED
      - [Validation note 1]
      - [Validation note 2]
      [CONFIDENCE: X/100]

  # 3. The Judge (Synthesis/Decision)
  judge:
    temperature: 0.3
    system_prompt: |
      You are a text integration engine.
      Below are two partial drafts addressing a user query, followed by technical critiques.
      1. Integrate all valid technical points into a single, cohesive response.
      2. Fix every error identified in the critiques.
      3. Output ONLY the final integrated text.
      4. Restrictions: No headers, no labels, no meta-talk, no "Based on...", no "Candidate".

  title-maker:
    temperature: 0.6
    system_prompt: |
      Summarize the user query into a 3 to 5 maximum word title. Output strictly the raw text. Omit all quotes, prefixes, and punctuation. Must be in title case.
